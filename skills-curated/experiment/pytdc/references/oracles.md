# Molecular generation and PyTDC oracles

This reference targets **PyTDC 1.1.15**, verified 2026-07-23. Oracle names and
behavior are heterogeneous. Discover the installed registry and classify side
effects before constructing an `Oracle`.

## PyTDC's role

Core PyTDC provides:

- molecular corpora through `tdc.generation.MolGen`;
- `Evaluator` functions for generated sets;
- scalar, composite, checkpoint-backed, remote-service, and docking oracles.

It does not supply one universal trainable molecule generator. Users bring or
implement the generative model and must define a scientifically justified
objective, constraints, validation protocol, and experimental follow-up.

## Discover names without calling an oracle

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script discover_metadata.py --kind oracles --limit 100
```

This reads `tdc.metadata.oracle_names`; it does not instantiate an oracle, download
a checkpoint/receptor, or transmit a SMILES string.

Use exact names. PyTDC fuzzy matching can silently normalize approximate input,
which is undesirable for expensive or remote operations.

## Side-effect categories in the stable metadata

### Local scalar property

Verified direct local scalar name:

```text
qed
```

`qed` requires RDKit but no PyTDC model artifact. It is the quantitative estimate
of drug-likeness; higher is more drug-like on its documented 0–1 scale.

Although upstream metadata groups `logp` and `sa` with “trivial” oracles, source
and execution verification show that both call `calculateScore`, which downloads
the `fpscores` artifact when absent. Treat both as download-backed.

### Local composite/GuacaMol-style objectives

The registry contains rediscovery, similarity, isomer, median, MPO, SMARTS, and hop
objectives. Some names use fixed targets; `*_meta` variants require constructor
arguments such as `target_smiles`.

Do not infer a constructor signature or score direction from the name. Read the
matching official oracle section and stable source before use. The bundled CLI does
not execute these objectives.

### Checkpoint-backed models

Stable download metadata includes:

```text
drd2, gsk3b, jnk3, cyp3a4_veith, fpscores,
drd2_current, gsk3b_current, jnk3_current
```

Constructing one can call Harvard Dataverse and write a model file beneath
`./oracle`. For DRD2/GSK3B/JNK3, PyTDC may normalize the request to a `_current`
checkpoint according to the installed scikit-learn version.

Checkpoint files are serialized model artifacts. Review source, origin, local path,
size, and trust boundary before download/loading. The bundled CLI supports only
bounded LogP/SA/DRD2/GSK3B/JNK3/CYP3A4_Veith calls and requires both `--execute`
and `--download`.

The 1.1.15 `LogP` oracle is not raw octanol/water partition alone. It implements
the normalized **penalized logP** objective: RDKit MolLogP plus a normalized
negative synthetic-accessibility term and a large-cycle penalty. Higher is the
objective's optimization direction. `SA` returns synthetic accessibility, for
which lower conventionally means easier synthesis. Do not combine either with
other scores without documenting transformation, scale, and direction.

### Distribution evaluators

The Oracle/Evaluator registries include:

```text
novelty, diversity, uniqueness, validity, fcd_distance, kl_divergence
```

These operate on collections, and several need a training/reference set. They are
not interchangeable scalar objectives:

- validity/uniqueness/novelty/diversity are higher by their documented definitions;
- FCD distance and KL divergence are lower as distance/divergence quantities;
- novelty and distribution comparisons depend on the exact reference corpus and
  canonicalization;
- optional chemical-model dependencies may be substantial.

Use `Evaluator` and the official input signature. Do not send these through the
bundled scalar-scoring helper.

### Remote synthesis services

Metadata includes `askcos` and `ibm_rxn`. They call external services that need
their own accounts and can transmit molecular structures. They are out of scope for
this skill, and the bundled script refuses them.

### Receptor and docking oracles

The registry contains PDB-specific names ending in `_docking`,
`_docking_normalize`, and `_docking_vina`, plus specialized names such as
`pyscreener`, `docking_score`, `smina`, `rmsd`, and `kabsch_rmsd`.

These paths can involve:

- receptor PDB/PDBQT downloads;
- local executables and substantial CPU/storage;
- user-specified box centers/sizes;
- generated conformers and temporary files;
- license restrictions for docking software;
- remote or proprietary synthesis scoring in benchmark evaluation.

Raw docking energies and normalized variants have different directions. Never infer
direction from a generic “Docking” label. The bundled molecular CLI and benchmark
CLI do not execute docking.

## Bounded local scoring

Plan first:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script molecular_generation.py score \
  --oracle QED \
  --smiles "CCO"
```

The JSON plan reports classification, input count, runtime directory, and required
acknowledgement. It does not instantiate `Oracle`.

Execute a local scalar only after review:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script molecular_generation.py score \
  --oracle QED \
  --smiles "CCO" \
  --execute
```

Execute a supported checkpoint-backed model only after approving the checkpoint:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script molecular_generation.py score \
  --oracle DRD2 \
  --smiles "CCO" \
  --runtime-dir .pytdc-oracles \
  --execute --download
```

The helper:

- accepts at most 500 SMILES and a 1 MiB input file;
- keeps output in input order;
- truncates long strings;
- never ranks candidates or assumes score direction;
- changes into the safe runtime directory so upstream `./oracle` writes remain
  contained;
- refuses remote services, docking, distribution metrics, and composite objectives.

## Direct Oracle API

After side-effect review:

```python
from tdc import Oracle

oracle = Oracle(name="QED", num_max_call=100)
scores = oracle(["CCO", "c1ccccc1"])
```

`num_max_call` bounds accumulated valid scalar calls for supported paths. It is not
a network timeout, memory limit, or cost limit.

For list input, PyTDC validates each SMILES with RDKit. Invalid entries can receive
the oracle's default value (commonly zero) rather than raising. Pre-validate
structures, preserve an explicit validity flag, and do not interpret the default as
a measured low score.

Oracle results are predictions or computed proxies, not experimental evidence.
Applicability domains, model training data, stereochemistry, protonation,
tautomerization, salts, and assay context can materially change interpretation.

## MolGen datasets

Discover the exact stable registry:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script discover_metadata.py --kind datasets --task MolGen
```

Plan a random split:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script molecular_generation.py dataset \
  --dataset MOSES \
  --seed 42 \
  --data-dir .pytdc-molgen
```

MolGen corpora can contain hundreds of thousands or millions of structures. Review
the official page, per-dataset license, compressed/decompressed size, free disk,
and network budget. Execution intentionally requires both flags:

```bash
ai4sci skill run pytdc --script molecular_generation.py dataset \
  --dataset MOSES \
  --seed 42 \
  --data-dir .pytdc-molgen \
  --execute --download
```

PyTDC 1.1.15's MolGen loader exposes random split only. The supplied seed controls
test sampling, while the generic splitter uses fixed `random_state=1` for
validation sampling.

## Goal-directed optimization safeguards

Before optimizing:

- define whether every objective is maximized, minimized, targeted, or constrained;
- normalize only with justified transformations;
- separate train, validation, and final evaluation budgets;
- cap total unique oracle calls and deduplicate canonical structures;
- record invalid/failed/time-out results rather than silently dropping them;
- retain all candidates and scores needed for audit, but keep chat/CLI output
  bounded;
- monitor exploitation of model artifacts and out-of-domain structures;
- evaluate novelty against the exact declared training/reference set;
- add medicinal-chemistry, synthesizability, selectivity, safety, and diversity
  review rather than relying on a single score;
- treat computational hits as hypotheses requiring expert and experimental
  validation.

Do not claim a weighted sum is scientifically valid merely because every term is
numerical.

## Unsupported historical examples removed

The stable 1.1.15 metadata/public imports do not support old examples that presented
the following as generic ready-to-use APIs:

- `PairMolGen` / `Prodrug`;
- `MolGen(name="GuacaMol")`;
- `evaluate_guacamol(...)`;
- scalar `MW`, `Lipinski`, generic `Docking`, or generic `Vina` oracle names;
- target oracles such as `5HT2A`, `ACE`, `MAPK`, `CDK`, `P38`, `PARP1`, or
  `PIK3CA`.

Do not restore these names without verifying a newer official package registry and
source implementation.
