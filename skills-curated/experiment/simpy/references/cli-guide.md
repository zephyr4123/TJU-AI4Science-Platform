# Bundled CLI guide

Verified 2026-07-23 for skill version 1.1 and SimPy 4.1.2.

The scripts implement one transparent finite-horizon exponential
arrival/exponential service multi-server queue. They are examples and diagnostics,
not a generic model execution platform.

## Safety contract

All scripts:

- use only SimPy and the Python standard library;
- build `--help` when SimPy is absent, so options remain inspectable before
  installation;
- make no network or external-service calls;
- accept only local regular files with fixed suffixes;
- reject URLs, symlinks, duplicate JSON keys, `NaN`/infinity, unknown keys, and
  oversized inputs;
- never evaluate configuration text, run user Python, resolve callables, or import
  plugins;
- enforce time, event, entity, queue, trace, and replication caps;
- emit strict deterministic JSON (`allow_nan=False`);
- write explicit outputs atomically with mode `0600`;
- refuse overwrite unless `--force` is supplied.

Run them with `ai4sci skill run simpy --script <file> …`: each script's lock file
pins SimPy 4.1.2, so no separate install is needed.

Commands that execute a simulation gate SimPy through a shared dependency loader.
If it is absent, they exit without a traceback and print a pinned installation
command. Configuration validation and artifact summarization remain usable
without SimPy.

## Queue configuration schema

Every field is optional; defaults are shown:

```json
{
  "analysis_mode": "terminating",
  "base_seed": 20260723,
  "horizon": 480.0,
  "max_entities": 10000,
  "max_events": 200000,
  "mean_interarrival": 4.0,
  "mean_service": 6.0,
  "queue_capacity": 20,
  "servers": 2,
  "warm_up": 0.0
}
```

Semantics:

- arrival and service durations are exponential means in the declared model time
  unit;
- there are `servers` simultaneous slots and at most `queue_capacity` waiting
  entities;
- an arrival seeing `servers + queue_capacity` admitted entities is rejected;
- arrivals and services use separate deterministic stream seeds;
- arrivals occur strictly before `horizon`;
- numeric horizon excludes ordinary events exactly at that time;
- completed-customer metrics exclude unfinished entities and disclose their count.

Bounds:

- `0 < horizon <= 1,000,000`;
- `1 <= servers <= 10,000`;
- `0 <= queue_capacity <= 100,000`;
- positive finite means no greater than 1,000,000;
- `1 <= max_entities <= 100,000`;
- `10 <= max_events <= 1,000,000`;
- base seed from 0 through `2^63 - 1`.

For `analysis_mode="terminating"`, `warm_up` must be zero. For
`analysis_mode="steady_state"`, warm-up must be positive and less than horizon.
This validates consistency only; it does not establish that steady state was
reached.

## Basic template

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script basic_simulation_template.py --help
ai4sci skill run simpy --script basic_simulation_template.py
ai4sci skill run simpy --script basic_simulation_template.py \
  --config queue.json --output run.json
```

`--replication INDEX` selects deterministic derived arrival/service seeds. It does
not itself create a confidence interval.

Library use (save `scripts/basic_simulation_template.py`, `scripts/resource_monitor.py`
and `scripts/_common.py` next to your code first; read each with
`ai4sci skill show simpy scripts/<file>`):

```python
from basic_simulation_template import QueueConfig, run_simulation

config = QueueConfig.from_mapping({"horizon": 120, "servers": 3})
report = run_simulation(config, replication=0)
```

## Bounded queue scenario and trace

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script bounded_queue_scenario.py \
  --config queue.json \
  --output scenario.json \
  --trace-output trace.jsonl \
  --trace-max-records 50000
```

The trace is capped and contains no event `repr`:

```json
{
  "event_id": 0,
  "event_type": "Initialize",
  "priority": 0,
  "queue_size_before": 1,
  "time": 0.0
}
```

The `.jsonl` file has one compact object per line. A trace can truncate while the
bounded simulation completes; the report discloses `trace.truncated`.

## Replication configuration schema

```json
{
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "model": {
    "analysis_mode": "terminating",
    "base_seed": 20260723,
    "horizon": 480,
    "max_entities": 10000,
    "max_events": 200000,
    "mean_interarrival": 4,
    "mean_service": 6,
    "queue_capacity": 20,
    "servers": 2,
    "warm_up": 0
  },
  "replications": 20
}
```

Additional experiment bounds:

- 2-1,000 replications; one-run confidence intervals are rejected;
- confidence strictly greater than 0.50 and at most 0.999;
- `replications * max_events <= 5,000,000`;
- `replications * max_entities <= 2,000,000`.

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script replication_runner.py --help
ai4sci skill run simpy --script replication_runner.py \
  --config experiment.json --output intervals.json
```

The runner makes a two-sided Student-t interval from independent
replication-level estimates. A metric undefined in any run is marked unavailable
instead of dropping that run. It never constructs a CI from individual customers
within one run.

The seed manifest uses stable BLAKE2b derivation for separate arrival/service RNG
objects. This is deterministic stream separation for the bundled example, not a
formal proof of independent substreams. See `simulation-methodology.md`.

## Configuration validator

Validation performs no simulation:

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script validate_simulation_config.py queue.json
ai4sci skill run simpy --script validate_simulation_config.py \
  experiment.json --schema replication
```

Schemas are `queue`, `replication`, or `auto`. Auto identifies the replication
schema by any top-level `model`, `replications`, or `confidence` key. There are no
custom model names, module paths, class names, predicates, or callable fields.

Unknown keys such as the following are rejected:

```json
{
  "plugin": "package.module",
  "python": "print('run me')"
}
```

## Event/resource artifact summarizer

Summarize a trace without importing or executing its originating model:

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script event_trace_summary.py trace.jsonl
```

Summarize ResourceMonitor CSV:

```bash
ai4sci skill run simpy --script resource_monitor.py \
  --samples resource.csv --output monitor.json
ai4sci skill run simpy --script event_trace_summary.py resource.csv
```

Accepted trace fields are exactly:

`event_id`, `event_type`, `priority`, `queue_size_before`, `time`.

Accepted resource CSV fields are exactly:

`time`, `event`, `count`, `queue_length`, `utilization`.

The summarizer checks event trace order by `(time, priority, event_id)` and computes
resource time averages by carrying each state left-continuously to the next sample.
It does not infer queue semantics from arbitrary column names.

## Resource monitor library

Save `scripts/resource_monitor.py` and `scripts/_common.py` next to your code first.

```python
from resource_monitor import EventTraceRecorder, ResourceMonitor

monitor = ResourceMonitor(env, server, "server")
trace = EventTraceRecorder(env, max_records=10_000)
env.run(until=100)
trace.detach()
monitor.finalize(at=100)

print(monitor.summary(start=20, end=100))
monitor.export_csv("resource.csv")
trace.export_jsonl("trace.jsonl")
```

The monitor patches one resource instance. Do not attach multiple wrappers to the
same resource. Its queue timing and private-API caveats are in `monitoring.md`.

## Exit behavior

Expected validation failures use `argparse` errors and nonzero exit status:

- malformed/unknown config;
- unsafe path or overwrite;
- event/entity/replication budget violation;
- event limit reached during the run;
- invalid trace/resource artifact.

An event-budget error is a failed/incomplete simulation, not a valid censored
result. Increase a cap only after diagnosing why it was reached.
