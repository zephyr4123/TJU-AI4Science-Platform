# Pull Request Documentation Template

> **Back to [Markdown Style Guide](../markdown_style_guide.md)** — Read the style guide first for formatting, citation, and emoji rules.

**Use this template for:** Documenting pull requests as persistent, searchable markdown records. This file IS the PR — not a companion document. It captures everything: what changed, why, how to verify, security impact, deployment strategy, and what was learned.

**Key features:** Summary with impact classification, change inventory with before/after, testing evidence, security review, breaking change documentation, deployment strategy, observability plan, rollback plan, and reviewer checklist.

**Philosophy:** This file IS the PR description — not a companion, not a supplement, not a copy. The GitHub PR is a thin pointer: humans go there to comment on diffs, approve, and watch CI. But the actual record — what changed, why it changed, testing evidence, rollback plan, and lessons learned — lives HERE, committed to the repo.

When someone asks "what was PR #123 about?" six months from now, they `grep docs/project/pr/`, not the GitHub API. When you migrate from GitHub to GitLab, every PR record comes with you. When an AI agent needs to understand the history of a module, it reads these files locally — no tokens, no rate limits, no platform dependency.

This is the [Everything is Code](../markdown_style_guide.md#-everything-is-code) philosophy: project management data lives in the repo, versioned and portable. Don't capture information in GitHub's UI that should be captured in this file. Invest the 10 minutes. A great PR file eliminates the "what was this PR about?" Slack message and the "can someone check the GitHub PR?" context switch — the answer is already in the repo.

## File Convention

```
docs/project/pr/pr-00000123-fix-auth-timeout.md
docs/project/pr/pr-00000124-add-job-retry-metrics.md
docs/project/pr/pr-00000125-refactor-ci-stage-order.md
```

- **Directory:** `docs/project/pr/`
- **Naming:** `pr-` + PR number zero-padded to 8 digits + `-` + short lowercase hyphenated description
- **Cross-reference:** Link to the live PR in the metadata table
- **GitHub PR body:** Use only the full branch URL to this file (for example, `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/docs/project/pr/pr-00000123-fix-auth-timeout.md`)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Strategy

**Approach:** [Standard deploy / Canary (N% → 100%) / Blue-green / Feature flag]

**Feature flags:** [Flag name: `[flag_name]` — default: [off/on], rollout: [%/audience]]

### Pre-deployment

- [ ] [Database migrations applied]
- [ ] [Environment variables set]
- [ ] [Dependent services deployed first: [service names]]
- [ ] [Feature flag configured in [flag management tool]]

### Post-deployment verification

- [ ] [Health check endpoint returns 200]
- [ ] [Key user flow verified: [which flow]]
- [ ] [Metrics baseline captured: [which metrics]]
- [ ] [No error rate spike in first [N] minutes]

---

## 📡 Observability

### Monitoring

- **Dashboard:** [Link to relevant dashboard or "existing dashboards sufficient"]
- **Key metrics to watch:** [Latency p95, error rate, throughput — be specific]
- **Watch window:** [How long to monitor post-deploy: 15m / 1h / 24h]

### Alerts

- [New alerts added: [alert name, threshold, channel]]
- [Existing alerts affected: [which ones and how]]
- [Or: "No alert changes needed"]

### Logging

- [New log entries: [what's logged, at what level]]
- [Changed log levels: [what changed and why]]
- [Or: "No logging changes"]

### Success criteria

[How do you know this deploy is healthy? Be specific: "p95 latency stays under 200ms, error rate stays below 0.1%, no new error types in logs for 1 hour."]
