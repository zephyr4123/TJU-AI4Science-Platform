the answers imply.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Methodology Critique

Evaluate research methodology for rigor, validity, and potential flaws.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing research papers
- Assessing experimental designs

- Planning new research

**Evaluation framework:**

1. **Study Design Assessment**
   - Is the design appropriate for the research question?
   - Can the design support causal claims being made?
   - Are comparison groups appropriate and adequate?
   - Consider whether experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational design is justified

2. **Validity Analysis**
   - **Internal validity:** Can we trust the causal inference?
     - Check randomization quality
     - Evaluate confounding control
     - Assess selection bias
     - Review attrition/dropout patterns
   - **External validity:** Do results generalize?

     - Assess whether measures are direct or proxy
   - **Statistical conclusion validity:** Are statistical inferences sound?
     - Verify adequate power/sample size
     - Check assumption compliance
     - Evaluate test appropriateness

3. **Control and Blinding**
   - Was randomization properly implemented (sequence generation, allocation concealment)?
   - Was blinding feasible and implemented (participants, providers, assessors)?
   - Are control conditions appropriate (placebo, active control, no treatment)?
   - Could performance or detection bias affect results?

4. **Measurement Quality**
   - Are instruments validated and reliable?
   - Are measures objective when possible, or subjective with acknowledged limitations?

**Reference:** See `references/scientific_method.md` for detailed principles and `references/experimental_design.md` for comprehensive design checklist.

### 2. Bias Detection

Identify and evaluate potential sources of bias that could distort findings.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing published research
- Designing new studies
- Interpreting conflicting evidence
- Assessing research quality

**Systematic bias review:**

1. **Cognitive Biases (Researcher)**
   - **Confirmation bias:** Are only supporting findings highlighted?
   - **HARKing:** Were hypotheses stated a priori or formed after seeing results?
   - **Publication bias:** Are negative results missing from literature?
   - **Cherry-picking:** Is evidence selectively reported?
   - Check for preregistration and analysis plan transparency

2. **Selection Biases**
   - **Sampling bias:** Is sample representative of target population?
   - **Volunteer bias:** Do participants self-select in systematic ways?
   - **Attrition bias:** Is dropout differential between groups?
   - **Survivorship bias:** Are only "survivors" visible in sample?
   - Examine participant flow diagrams and compare baseline characteristics

3. **Measurement Biases**
   - **Observer bias:** Could expectations influence observations?
   - **Recall bias:** Are retrospective reports systematically inaccurate?
   - **Social desirability:** Are responses biased toward acceptability?
   - **Instrument bias:** Do measurement tools systematically err?
   - Evaluate blinding, validation, and measurement objectivity

4. **Analysis Biases**
   - **P-hacking:** Were multiple analyses conducted until significance emerged?
   - **Outcome switching:** Were non-significant outcomes replaced with significant ones?
   - **Selective reporting:** Are all planned analyses reported?
   - **Subgroup fishing:** Were subgroup analyses conducted without correction?
   - Check for study registration and compare to published outcomes

5. **Confounding**
   - What variables could affect both exposure and outcome?
   - Were confounders measured and controlled (statistically or by design)?
   - Could unmeasured confounding explain findings?
   - Are there plausible alternative explanations?

**Reference:** See `references/common_biases.md` for comprehensive bias taxonomy with detection and mitigation strategies.

### 3. Statistical Analysis Evaluation

Critically assess statistical methods, interpretation, and reporting.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing quantitative research
- Evaluating data-driven claims
- Assessing clinical trial results
- Reviewing meta-analyses

**Statistical review checklist:**

1. **Sample Size and Power**
   - Was a priori power analysis conducted?
   - Is sample adequate for detecting meaningful effects?
   - Is the study underpowered (common problem)?
   - Do significant results from small samples raise flags for inflated effect sizes?

2. **Statistical Tests**
   - Are tests appropriate for data type and distribution?
   - Were test assumptions checked and met?
   - Are parametric tests justified, or should non-parametric alternatives be used?
   - Is the analysis matched to study design (e.g., paired vs. independent)?

3. **Multiple Comparisons**
   - Were multiple hypotheses tested?
   - Was correction applied (Bonferroni, FDR, other)?
   - Are primary outcomes distinguished from secondary/exploratory?
   - Could findings be false positives from multiple testing?

4. **P-Value Interpretation**
   - Are p-values interpreted correctly (probability of data if null is true)?
   - Is non-significance incorrectly interpreted as "no effect"?
   - Is statistical significance conflated with practical importance?
   - Are exact p-values reported, or only "p < .05"?
   - Is there suspicious clustering just below .05?

5. **Effect Sizes and Confidence Intervals**
   - Are effect sizes reported alongside significance?
   - Are confidence intervals provided to show precision?
   - Is the effect size meaningful in practical terms?
   - Are standardized effect sizes interpreted with field-specific context?

6. **Missing Data**
   - How much data is missing?
   - Is missing data mechanism considered (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)?
   - How is missing data handled (deletion, imputation, maximum likelihood)?
   - Could missing data bias results?

7. **Regression and Modeling**
   - Is the model overfitted (too many predictors, no cross-validation)?
   - Are predictions made outside the data range (extrapolation)?
   - Are multicollinearity issues addressed?
   - Are model assumptions checked?

8. **Common Pitfalls**
   - Correlation treated as causation
   - Ignoring regression to the mean
   - Base rate neglect
   - Texas sharpshooter fallacy (pattern finding in noise)
   - Simpson's paradox (confounding by subgroups)

**Reference:** See `references/statistical_pitfalls.md` for detailed pitfalls and correct practices.

### 4. Evidence Quality Assessment

Evaluate the strength and quality of evidence systematically.

**Apply when:**
- Weighing evidence for decisions
- Conducting literature reviews
- Comparing conflicting findings
- Determining confidence in conclusions

**Evidence evaluation framework:**

1. **Study Design Hierarchy**
   - Systematic reviews/meta-analyses (highest for intervention effects)
   - Randomized controlled trials
   - Cohort studies
   - Case-control studies
   - Cross-sectional studies
   - Case series/reports
   - Expert opinion (lowest)

   **Important:** Higher-level designs aren't always better quality. A well-designed observational study can be stronger than a poorly-conducted RCT.

2. **Quality Within Design Type**
   - Risk of bias assessment (use appropriate tool: Cochrane RoB 2 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, Newcastle-Ottawa, etc.)
   - Methodological rigor
   - Transparency and reporting completeness
   - Conflicts of interest

3. **GRADE Considerations (if applicable)**
   - Start with design type (RCT = high, observational = low)
   - **Downgrade for:**
     - Risk of bias
     - Inconsistency across studies
     - Indirectness (wrong population/intervention/outcome)
     - Imprecision (wide confidence intervals, small samples)
     - Publication bias
   - **Upgrade for:**
     - Large effect sizes
     - Dose-response relationships
     - Confounders would reduce (not increase) effect

4. **Convergence of Evidence**
   - **Stronger when:**
     - Multiple independent replications
     - Different research groups and settings
     - Different methodologies converge on same conclusion
     - Mechanistic and empirical evidence align
   - **Weaker when:**
     - Single study or research group
     - Contradictory findings in literature
     - Publication bias evident
     - No replication attempts

5. **Contextual Factors**
   - Biological/theoretical plausibility
   - Consistency with established knowledge
   - Temporality (cause precedes effect)
   - Specificity of relationship
   - Strength of association

**Reference:** See `references/evidence_hierarchy.md` for detailed hierarchy, GRADE system, and quality assessment tools.

### 5. Logical Fallacy Identification

Detect and name logical errors in scientific arguments and claims.

**Apply when:**
- Evaluating scientific claims
- Reviewing discussion/conclusion sections
- Assessing popular science communication
- Identifying flawed reasoning

**Common fallacies in science:**

1. **Causation Fallacies**
   - **Post hoc ergo propter hoc:** "B followed A, so A caused B"
   - **Correlation = causation:** Confusing association with causality
   - **Reverse causation:** Mistaking cause for effect
   - **Single cause fallacy:** Attributing complex outcomes to one factor

2. **Generalization Fallacies**
   - **Hasty generalization:** Broad conclusions from small samples
   - **Anecdotal fallacy:** Personal stories as proof
   - **Cherry-picking:** Selecting only supporting evidence
   - **Ecological fallacy:** Group patterns applied to individuals

3. **Authority and Source Fallacies**
   - **Appeal to authority:** "Expert said it, so it's true" (without evidence)
   - **Ad hominem:** Attacking person, not argument
   - **Genetic fallacy:** Judging by origin, not merits
   - **Appeal to nature:** "Natural = good/safe"

4. **Statistical Fallacies**
   - **Base rate neglect:** Ignoring prior probability
   - **Texas sharpshooter:** Finding patterns in random data
   - **Multiple comparisons:** Not correcting for multiple tests
   - **Prosecutor's fallacy:** Confusing P(E|H) with P(H|E)

5. **Structural Fallacies**
   - **False dichotomy:** "Either A or B" when more options exist
   - **Moving goalposts:** Changing evidence standards after they're met
   - **Begging the question:** Circular reasoning
   - **Straw man:** Misrepresenting arguments to attack them

6. **Science-Specific Fallacies**
   - **Galileo gambit:** "They laughed at Galileo, so my fringe idea is correct"
   - **Argument from ignorance:** "Not proven false, so true"
   - **Nirvana fallacy:** Rejecting imperfect solutions
   - **Unfalsifiability:** Making untestable claims

**When identifying fallacies:**
- Name the specific fallacy
- Explain why the reasoning is flawed
- Identify what evidence would be needed for valid inference
- Note that fallacious reasoning doesn't prove the conclusion false—just that this argument doesn't support it

**Reference:** See `references/logical_fallacies.md` for comprehensive fallacy catalog with examples and detection strategies.

### 6. Research Design Guidance

Provide constructive guidance for planning rigorous studies.

**Apply when:**
- Helping design new experiments
- Planning research projects
- Reviewing research proposals
- Improving study protocols

**Design process:**

1. **Research Question Refinement**
   - Ensure question is specific, answerable, and falsifiable
   - Verify it addresses a gap or contradiction in literature
   - Confirm feasibility (resources, ethics, time)
   - Define variables operationally

2. **Design Selection**
   - Match design to question (causal → experimental; associational → observational)
   - Consider feasibility and ethical constraints
   - Choose between-subjects, within-subjects, or mixed designs
   - Plan factorial designs if testing multiple factors

3. **Bias Minimization Strategy**
   - Implement randomization when possible
   - Plan blinding at all feasible levels (participants, providers, assessors)
   - Identify and plan to control confounds (randomization, matching, stratification, statistical adjustment)
   - Standardize all procedures
   - Plan to minimize attrition

4. **Sample Planning**
   - Conduct a priori power analysis (specify expected effect, desired power, alpha)
   - Account for attrition in sample size
   - Define clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Consider recruitment strategy and feasibility
   - Plan for sample representativeness

5. **Measurement Strategy**
   - Select validated, reliable instruments
   - Use objective measures when possible
   - Plan multiple measures of key constructs (triangulation)
   - Ensure measures are sensitive to expected changes
   - Establish inter-rater reliability procedures

6. **Analysis Planning**
   - Prespecify all hypotheses and analyses
   - Designate primary outcome clearly
   - Plan statistical tests with assumption checks
   - Specify how missing data will be handled
   - Plan to report effect sizes and confidence intervals
   - Consider multiple comparison corrections

7. **Transparency and Rigor**
   - Preregister study and analysis plan
   - Use reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA)
   - Plan to report all outcomes, not just significant ones
   - Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses
   - Commit to data/code sharing

**Reference:** See `references/experimental_design.md` for comprehensive design checklist covering all stages from question to dissemination.

### 7. Claim Evaluation

Systematically evaluate scientific claims for validity and support.

**Apply when:**
- Assessing conclusions in papers
- Evaluating media reports of research
- Reviewing abstract or introduction claims
- Checking if data support conclusions

**Claim evaluation process:**

1. **Identify the Claim**
   - What exactly is being claimed?
   - Is it a causal claim, associational claim, or descriptive claim?
   - How strong is the claim (proven, likely, suggested, possible)?

2. **Assess the Evidence**
   - What evidence is provided?
   - Is evidence direct or indirect?
   - Is evidence sufficient for the strength of claim?
   - Are alternative explanations ruled out?

3. **Check Logical Connection**
   - Do conclusions follow from the data?
   - Are there logical leaps?
   - Is correlational data used to support causal claims?
   - Are limitations acknowledged?

4. **Evaluate Proportionality**
   - Is confidence proportional to evidence strength?
   - Are hedging words used appropriately?
   - Are limitations downplayed?
   - Is speculation clearly labeled?

5. **Check for Overgeneralization**
   - Do claims extend beyond the sample studied?
   - Are population restrictions acknowledged?
   - Is context-dependence recognized?
   - Are caveats about generalization included?

6. **Red Flags**
   - Causal language from correlational studies
   - "Proves" or absolute certainty
   - Cherry-picked citations
   - Ignoring contradictory evidence
   - Dismissing limitations
   - Extrapolation beyond data

**Provide specific feedback:**
- Quote the problematic claim
- Explain what evidence would be needed to support it
- Suggest appropriate hedging language if warranted
- Distinguish between data (what was found) and interpretation (what it means)
