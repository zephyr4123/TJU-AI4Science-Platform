# Local Deterministic Tooling

## Security properties

Every bundled script:

- uses only the Python standard library;
- reads bounded local `.json` or `.csv` files;
- rejects symbolic-link inputs, duplicate JSON keys, excessive depth or size,
  non-finite numbers, unknown schema fields, and common private-application
  fields;
- uses fixed schemas and never executes supplied text;
- has no network, model, credential, environment-file, dynamic-code,
  executable-serialization, or child-process behavior;
- writes only minimized JSON reports and refuses to overwrite by default; and
- does not copy evidence excerpts or raw source documents.

Inputs are limited to 2 MiB, JSON depth 20, 25,000 structure nodes, 50 rubric
criteria, 50 comparison evaluations, and 20,000 agreement rows. Outputs are
limited to 2 MiB.

Use an authorized local directory. Keep private source documents in the
institution's records system and reference them with opaque local identifiers.

## Templates

- `assets/rubric_template.json` — valid structure, but deliberately records
  content validity as not established.
- `assets/evaluation_template.json` — structurally valid all-missing example.
- `assets/evidence_manifest_template.json` — synthetic local-reference records.
- `assets/process_checklist_template.json` — fail-closed unconfirmed controls.
- `assets/ratings_template.csv` — pseudonymous synthetic agreement data.

Copy a template into an authorized working directory before editing it (read it with `ai4sci skill show scholar-evaluation assets/<file>`); the commands below read those copies. Do not
replace synthetic identifiers with names or contact information.

## 1. Rubric schema validation

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script validate_rubric.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json
```

The validator checks:

- fixed intended use and scholarly-work unit;
- complete prohibited-use list;
- construct, boundaries, limitations, and provenance;
- content-validity status and reference;
- bounded scale and complete anchors;
- unique criteria and weights summing to one;
- absence of common scored proxy measures;
- required rater training, calibration, agreement, separately recorded
  inter-rater reliability status, and drift controls; and
- committee, conflict, appeal, accessibility, data-protection, subgroup, and
  review-cycle governance.

A rubric can be structurally `valid` while warning that content validity is not
documented. Structural validity is not psychometric validity.

## 2. Bounded descriptive scoring

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script calculate_scores.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --evaluation evaluation_template.json \
  --output scholar-score.json
```

The evaluation contains one entry for every criterion:

```json
{
  "criterion_id": "method_design",
  "status": "rated",
  "score": 3,
  "uncertainty": 0.5,
  "evidence_ids": ["EVIDENCE-SYNTHETIC-METHOD"],
  "rationale_ref": "LOCAL-RATING-RATIONALE-METHOD"
}
```

For `missing` or `not_applicable`, `score` and `uncertainty` must be null and
`evidence_ids` must be empty. A local rationale reference remains required.

The output reports weighted contributions, coverage, missing and
not-applicable weight, normalized score, and a bounded uncertainty range. It
contains no quality label, threshold, decision, or recommendation.

## 3. Evidence traceability

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script check_traceability.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --evaluation evaluation_template.json \
  --evidence evidence_manifest_template.json
```

The checker verifies that:

- manifest, evaluation, work, and classification identifiers match;
- every evidence identifier is unique;
- every rated evidence reference resolves;
- evidence is linked to the criterion that cites it;
- source and access types are allowed; and
- evidence is available and verified.

It reports identifiers, paths, and counts only. It never opens or copies the
referenced source.

## 4. Weight sensitivity and rank instability

Provide two to 50 evaluation JSON files for distinct scholarly works:

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script weight_sensitivity.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --evaluation work-a-evaluation.json \
  --evaluation work-b-evaluation.json \
  --delta 0.2 \
  --output weight-sensitivity.json
```

For each criterion, the script multiplies its weight by `1-delta` and
`1+delta`, renormalizes all weights to one, and recomputes descriptive scores.
It reports:

- every scenario and its exact weights;
- each work's score and coverage per scenario;
- score ranges;
- base ordinal order; and
- pairwise order changes.

The base order is included solely to detect instability. It is not a ranking
recommendation and must never be used for people or high-impact decisions.

## 5. Inter-rater agreement summaries

The CSV header must be exactly:

```text
evaluation_id,work_id,rater_id,criterion_id,status,score
```

Use pseudonymous rater identifiers. Run:

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script summarize_agreement.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --ratings ratings_template.csv \
  --output agreement-summary.json
```

For each criterion and overall, the report includes:

- pair observations;
- exact agreement rate;
- within-one-scale-step agreement rate;
- mean absolute difference;
- overlap, rated, missing, and not-applicable counts.

Rater identifiers are not emitted. These are descriptive agreement summaries,
not chance-corrected reliability, generalizability, validity, or fairness
evidence.

## 6. Bias and process checklist

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script check_process.py \
  --process process_checklist_template.json
```

The template is intentionally unconfirmed and therefore does not pass. Complete
it only from documented local records. The checker covers:

- qualified committee and training;
- conflicts and recusal;
- appeal and correction;
- accessibility and accommodations;
- purpose limitation, minimization, access, retention, and output controls;
- construct, provenance, content evidence, rater quality, agreement,
  inter-rater reliability review, uncertainty, missingness, traceability, and
  sensitivity;
- stakeholder, disciplinary, subgroup, and protected-attribute safeguards;
- no automation, person ranking, or decision recommendation; and
- drift, unintended-consequence, and periodic review.

`high_impact_use: true` or any unconfirmed decision control blocks the process.
The checklist does not authorize a prohibited use.

## 7. Report scaffold

Generate a minimized scaffold:

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script generate_report_scaffold.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --evaluation evaluation_template.json \
  --output developmental-report-scaffold.json
```

Optional companion reports:

```bash
ai4sci skill run scholar-evaluation --script generate_report_scaffold.py \
  --rubric rubric_template.json \
  --evaluation work-a-evaluation.json \
  --traceability traceability.json \
  --agreement agreement-summary.json \
  --sensitivity weight-sensitivity.json \
  --process process-check.json \
  --output developmental-report-scaffold.json
```

The scaffold includes:

- construct and provenance status;
- descriptive scores and uncertainty;
- empty local-reference slots for evidence, strengths, limitations, and
  improvement options;
- minimized quality-assurance statuses; and
- fixed limitations and human-review fields.

It does not draft findings from source documents or issue a decision.

## Exit behavior

- exit `0`: requested calculation or validation completed successfully;
- exit `2`: invalid, blocked, incomplete, failed traceability, or unsafe input.

Errors contain only stable codes and JSON paths, never supplied values. Use
`--force` only when replacing a known local report.
